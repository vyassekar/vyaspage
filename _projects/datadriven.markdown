The last few years have witnessed the coming of age of data-driven paradigm in
various aspects of computing (partly) empowered by advances in distributed
system research (cloud computing, MapReduce, etc). In this work, we observe
that the benefits can flow the opposite direction: the design and management of
networked systems and security solutions can be improved by data-driven
paradigm. To this end, we are exploring new  data-driven paradigms that have
the the potential to significantly achieve better performance and security.
Our overarching vision is to create unified framework for DDN to tackle  common
challenges and  create reusable design principles. We believe that by
systematizing this paradigm as a broader community, we can unleash the
unharnessed potential of DDN.
