The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has quickly moved from concept to reality, with
estimates that the number of deployed IoT devices will rise to 25 billion in
2020. However, studies show that many IoT devices have serious security
vulnerabilities. Moreover, the limitations of IoT devices and scale of networks
of IoT devices often make traditional IT security approaches impractical. This
project takes a first-principles approach to rethinking network security and
address these concerns for IoT networks: (1) scalable alternatives to simple
perimeter defenses; (2) new methods to manage security in deployed networks of
IoT devices; and (3) new security policies with sufficient generality to
administer IoT devices and networks in many diverse use-cases.  By providing a
principled architecture to secure IoT deployments, the project will help
realize the full potential societal benefits of IoT. The project will result in
the development of novel open-source tools, modeling abstractions, algorithms,
and prototype implementations that will reduce the time to deploy novel IoT
security solutions, and make the results of the project available to the
community.
