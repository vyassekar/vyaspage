The state of network security today is quite abysmal. Security breaches and
downtime of critical infrastructures continue to be the norm rather than the
exception, despite the dramatic rise in spending on network security.
Attackers today can easily leverage a distributed and programmable
infrastructure of compromised machines (or botnets) to launch large-scale and
sophisticated attacks.  In contrast, the defenders of our critical
infrastructures are crippled as they rely on fixed capacity, inflexible, and
expensive hardware appliances. This forces them  into adopting weak and static
security postures, as they face unpleasant tradeoffs between false positives
and false negatives.  Continuing along this trajectory means that attackers
will always hold the upper hand as defenders are stifled by the inflexible and
impotent tools in their arsenal.  The goal of this project  is to reverse this
long-standing asymmetry and fundamentally change the dynamics of this attack-
defense equation. Instead of developing attack-specific defenses, we focus  on
empowering defenders with the right tools and abstractions to tackle the
constantly evolving attack landscape. To this end, we envision a new
software-defined approach to network security, where we can rapidly develop and
deploy novel in-depth defenses and dynamically customize the network’s security
posture to the current operating context.  Realizing this vision raises
fundamental challenges that transcend conventional networking and security
technologies and necessitates a radical rethink across the entire “stack”.
